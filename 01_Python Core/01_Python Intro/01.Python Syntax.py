# Syntax

# What is Syntax in Python?
# Syntax refers to the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols
# that are considered to be correctly structured programs in that language.

# Execute a simple print statement in Python

print("Hello, World!") # <-- Correct Syntax


# Syntax Error Example

## print("Hello, World") <---- Error: Missing closing parenthesis

# Sum
print(5 + 3) # <-- Correct Syntax answer is 8

# Minus
print(10 - 4) # <-- Correct Syntax answer is 6





# Indentation

# Indentation is crucial in Python as it defines the blocks of code.

# Correct Indentation Example:

if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")  # <-- Correct Indentation
# Incorrect Indentation Example
# if 5 > 2:
# print("Five is greater than two!")  # <-- Error: IndentationError

# Loop with Indentation
while True:
    print("This will print forever until you stop it!")  # <-- Correct Indentation
    break  # To prevent infinite loop in this example
# Incorrect Indentation Example
# while True:
# print("This will print forever until you stop it!")  # <-- Error: IndentationError
# break  # To prevent infinite loop in this example




# Comments

# ----> Comments are used to explain code and are ignored by the Python interpreter. <------

# Single-line comment
# Single-line comment are created using the hash symbol (#).
# This is a single-line comment in Python <-----


# Multi-line comment
